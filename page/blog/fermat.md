# Fermat's little theorem: How a gem from the past is crucial for our present.

One famous theorem in mathematics is fermat's little theorem, or the slighlty more general Euler's theorem.
One thing I really like about it is the following: It's proof is really simple, once you introduce group theory.
Euler's theorem is the basis of RSA encryption, which is help to keep everything to you on the web private. It's thanks
to RSA, or more general asymetric encryption that prevents people from stealing your bank account detail or your facebook password.
