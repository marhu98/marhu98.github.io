<h2 id="this-is-a-rant-about-why-should-never-ever-waste-your-time-with-a-french-bank-let-it-bnp-or-societé-generale-or-whatever.">This is a rant about why should never, ever waste your time with a french bank, let it BNP or Societé Generale or whatever.</h2>
<h3 id="part-one">Part one</h3>
<p>By early September 2020, me and my girl arrived to Paris to study mathematics. One of the earlier tasks we had to fulfill was to open a bank account. Unbeknowst to us this would prove a herculian task, mainly due to the gross incompetence of someone who we shall call Monsieur L’inutile.</p>
<p>But first, how did we get to meet such a character. Since me and my girl shared the room where we lived and basically almost of all our expenses, we decided to open a joint bank account. Now, it is important to say that while she spoke french, at the time I did not. So we tried to find a branch where the bank clerk spoke english.</p>
<p>However, here is something that french people won’t tell you, the sign on the door saying: “On parle anglais” is just there for the looks. They don’t actually speak english, they don’t even know how to say their name in english. This might look like an exageration, but I guarantee you it is not.</p>
<p>Since we couldn’t find an english-speaking bank clerk in the whole of Paris, we decided to settle for certain bank that offered a free bank account, at least to students. This is another thing that is most annoying to spanish people going to Paris. We are used to bank accounts being free. This is unimaginable for a parisian.</p>
<p>Hence, we booked an appointment with the branch manager. A man who at the moment of meeting seemed like a very nice person. He quickly asked us for the usual stuff: Identification, proof of adress, etc. I reminded him that he needed some extra paperwork because I was also a US citizen. He quickly dismissed me, probably because he could not understand my poor french. So I asked my girlfriend to repeat it back to him. Again he ignored me.</p>
<p>Then he spent the next two hours trying to open a bank account for us, he couldn’t. We were starting to get nervous, since we had left lentile soup on the stove. This dish usually takes about an hour to be cooked. We thought one hour would be more than enough time to finish the process. We were wrong.</p>
<p>At this point, I reminded him that he was missing important paperwork. He noded it off and told us he would call us back when he had solved the problem.</p>
<p>He did not call, but he gave us his business card, so we called him. He made some excuses and told us he would call us in two days. One week later we called him, he hadn’t called back. Made some more excuses and told us to try better luck in a different branch.</p>
<h3 id="part-two">Part two</h3>
<p>Therefore, we headed to a different branch. In this one, the clerk, which happened to be an intern, did realize that the previously missing paperwork was needed. And so everything was loooking good. Except a few days latter we got an email from an employee of the bank telling us we couldn’t open a bank account on the new branch, because we had already opened one in Monsieur L’inutile’s branch.</p>
<p>So, I went to talk to Monsieur L’Inutile. I went to his branch and I stood in the reception for about 30 min. It is important to say that at that moment Paris was in a state of emergency for terrorist threat. And yet, there I stood, in the middle of a bank, with my backpack in my bag filled with god know what. I could have, wihout any trouble whatsoever, left my backpack in the bank and left. Of course, in my backpack there were nothing but books, pen and paper. But at this point, I was so annoyed at the incompetence of this particular branch that I coudl almost be forgiven for having the thought that blowing it up would have being a step forward.</p>
<p>Anyway, since I got tired of waiting, I just shouted into the lobby: “Eeeeeeoooooo”. Five minutes latter a lacky appeared and asked me what I wanted, I showed him the email and he told me Monsieur L’Inutile would call me first thing tomorrow.</p>
<p>Let’s play a little game, did Monsieur L’Inutile, call or not? If you guess yes, you’re wrong. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and waited for another day, then called. More excuses and told me… Yes! He would call. I wrote him an email explaining very clearly that he had to file the proper paperwork.</p>
<p>How did he react? He did not reply, and when I called him a couple of days latter he said: “I can’t help you, you have to go to other bank”. What?? He told us to go to another bank? To go to their competitors? So I did what any sensible person would do. I ratted him out to his supervisor, Mme Stanzack, who very nicely told use she would do it.</p>
<p>Her work wasn’t perfect, since it took her more than two weeks to open the bank account, but she did it. Something is something. It had taken us a month and two weeks, but we had made it, we had did the most basic thing someone can do, open a bank account.</p>
<h3 id="the-kicker">The kicker</h3>
<p>Now, here is the kicker, in the meantime, we went to a spanisih bank in Paris. We arrived at noon, and left before lunchtime. And we had no problems whatsoever with this bank.</p>
