# Passwords: You're (most likely) doing it wrong

There are a worrying amount of people who use a single unsecure password for everything.
Your passwords are they key to a huge amount of private data that you might not like if it gets public: Most notablyyour mail account. 

Why? Someone with access to your mail account login credentials has access to everything: Your bank account, and by extension your money. And any other sensitive info, maybe your credit/debit card pins, your photos, your texts, what you spent you money on, etc.
