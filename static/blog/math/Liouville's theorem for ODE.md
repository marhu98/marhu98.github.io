# Liouville's theorem for ODE

One very suprising result in the study of differential equations is Liouville's theorem, it states that
if differential equations given by a field $X$ where $div X=0$ preserves volumnes. 

As one of my professors put it: If you follow the image of a cat face under the flow, then the area of the face is preserved,
although the face might be deformed. Here we can see an example of randomly generated field (random among fields of divergence 0).

## Proof
And the proof is not even that hard. Let's take a look.
