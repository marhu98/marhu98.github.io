# Convolution: Simpler than you think

When I was first taugh about the convolution I didn't not understand where the formula came from.
I understand that it was useful for smoothing out a function if convoluted with an appropiately smooth function.

This was until a professor showed me [link](Gontier) that convolution is a simple generalisation
of "averaging". Let me explain.
